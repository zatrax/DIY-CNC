DIY-CNC
=======

3-axis CNC Prototype using easily available parts.

The CNC is still in the building process and the Z-axis does need to be redesigned because of it's complexity. 

This is a project that I have lying around and I will continue working on it as soon as I have time.

All the design has been done using Solidworks.

eDrawing Viewer can be downloaded freely to view the parts.

If anyone is interested contributing to this project please let me know.
